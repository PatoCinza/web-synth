# Web Synth

A synth, mostly to be able to create chords and melodies with a "cyberpunk" feel, with that odd heavy distorted ugly sound that only your web api can make, all that via console for now.

Other application of this is if you want to train your ears with an completely new timbre, you can listen to intervals that it will play, or try to sing the scales with the `playMajorScale` and `playMinorScale` functions

## To do:
 - Play any major and minor triad and tetrad (tonic, fifth, tonic, third just like a guitar would do)
 - A friendly api to customize chords (maybe you want to play the strokes?)
 - A music sheet view to visualize songs and create arrangements
 - Multi track simultaneous playing
 - Use indexed DB to save arrangements
 - Adapt a pattern to be able to export scores to other platforms
